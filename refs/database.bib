Over this decade, graphene has proven to be attractive for thin-film transistors owing to its remarkable electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties. Even its major drawback—zero bandgap—has resulted in something positive: a resurgence of interest in two-dimensional semiconductors, such as dichalcogenides and buckled nanomaterials with sizeable bandgaps. With the discovery of hexagonal boron nitride as an ideal dielectric, the materials are now in place to advance integrated flexible nanoelectronics, which uniquely take advantage of the unmatched portfolio of properties of two-dimensional crystals, beyond the capability of conventional thin films for ubiquitous flexible systems."

	abstract = {Atomic crystals of two-dimensional materials consisting of single sheets extracted from layered materials are gaining increasing attention. The most well-known material from this group is graphene, a single layer of graphite that can be extracted from the bulk material or grown on a suitable substrate. Its discovery has given rise to intense research effort culminating in the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin . Graphene however represents only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, and increasing attention of researchers is now turning towards the veritable zoo of so-called “other 2D materials”. They have properties complementary to graphene, which in its pristine form lacks a bandgap: MoS2, for example, is a semiconductor, while NbSe2 is a superconductor. They could hold the key to important practical applications and new scientific discoveries in the two-dimensional limit. This family of materials has been studied since the 1960s, but most of the research focused on their tribological applications: MoS2 is best known today as a high-performance dry lubricant for ultrahigh-vacuum applications and in car engines. The realization that single layers of MoS2 and related materials could also be used in functional electronic devices where they could offer advantages compared with silicon or graphene created a renewed interest in these materials. MoS2 is currently gaining the most attention because the material is easily available in the form of a mineral, molybdenite, but other 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors are expected to have qualitatively similar properties. In this Account, we describe recent progress in the area of single-layer MoS2-based devices for electronic circuits. We will start with MoS2 transistors, which showed for the first time that devices based on MoS2 and related TMDs could have electrical properties on the same level as other, more established semiconducting materials. This allowed rapid progress in this area and was followed by demonstrations of basic digital circuits and transistors operating in the technologically relevant gigahertz range of frequencies, showing that the mobility of MoS2 and TMD materials is sufficiently high to allow device operation at such high frequencies. Monolayer MoS2 and other TMDs are also direct band gap semiconductors making them interesting for realizing optoelectronic devices. These range from simple phototransistors showing high sensitivity and low noise, to light emitting diodes and solar cells. All the electronic and optoelectronic properties of MoS2 and TMDs are accompanied by interesting mechanical properties with monolayer MoS2 being as stiff as steel and 30× stronger. This makes it especially interesting in the context of flexible electronics where it could combine the high degree of mechanical flexibility commonly associated with organic semiconductors with high levels of electrical performance. All these results show that MoS2 and TMDs are promising materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications.}

The first, already remarkably complex, such heterostructures (often referred to as ‘van der Waals’) have recently been fabricated and investigated, revealing unusual properties and new phenomena. Here we review this emerging research area and identify possible future directions. With steady improvement in fabrication techniques and using graphene’s springboard, van der Waals heterostructures should develop into a large field of their own.}

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are layered materials with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions enabling exfoliation into two-dimensional layers of single unit cell thickness. Although TMDCs have been studied for decades, recent advances in nanoscale materials characterization and device fabrication have opened up new opportunities for two-dimensional layers of thin TMDCs in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. TMDCs such as MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2 have sizable bandgaps that change from indirect to direct in single layers, allowing applications such as transistors, photodetectors and electroluminescent devices. We review the historical development of TMDCs, methods for preparing atomically thin layers, their electronic and optical properties, and prospects for future advances in electronics and optoelectronics.}

Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.}

Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties3. Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms4, 5, 6. Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances7. Finding a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material with adequate modulation speed and strength has therefore become a task of not only scientific interest, but also industrial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, high-speed, waveguide-integrated electroabsorption modulator based on monolayer graphene. By electrically tuning the Fermi level of the graphene sheet, we demonstrate modulation of the guided light at frequencies over 1 GHz, together with a broad operation spectrum that ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 µm under ambient conditions. The high modulation efficiency of graphene results in an active device area of merely 25 µm2, which is among the smallest to date. This graphene-based optical modulation mechanism, with combined advantages of compact footprint, low operation voltage and ultrafast modulation speed across a broad range of wavelengths, can enable novel architectures for on-chip optical communications.}

Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.}

Non-covalent self-assembly of a perylene thiol derivative (ETPTCDI) on the basal plane of GO forms graphene by reducing the dispersed GO and serves as an excellent two-dimensional template in solution for in situ nucleation and growth of gold nanodots via thiol-Au bonding. We characterized the resulting RGO-ETPTCDI-GND in detail and confirm that the Au nanodots with unique size ([similar]2 nm) decorate the RGO-ETPTCDI sheets uniformly due to the self-assembly of ETPTCDI molecules on the basal plane of graphene. We demonstrate that our RGO-ETPTCDI-GND sheets have astonishing dispersibility{,} reliability{,} and processibility. The uniform decoration of the [similar]2 nm GNDs on the graphene surface makes it possible to use the nanodots as a contrast enhancement agent for easily revealing the fine structure of the graphene surface. The electrochemical activity of our RGO-ETPTCDI-GND modified glassy carbon electrode showed significant improvement{,} suggesting RGO-ETPTCDI-GND as an attractive robust and advanced hybrid electrode material with great promise for electrochemical sensors and energy conversion."}

The transmission spectra of the family have been correlated group by group with the wide range of electrical and structural data available to yield useful working band models that are in accord with a molecular orbital approach. Several special topics have arisen; these include exciton screening, d-band formation, and the metal/insulator transition; also magnetism and superconductivity in such compounds.

Among the possible substitutional dopants at the Mo site, Nb is identified as suitable p-type dopant, while Re is the donor with the lowest activation energy. When dopants are simply adsorbed on a monolayer we find that alkali metals shift the Fermi energy into the MoS2 conduction band, making the system n type. Finally, the adsorption of charged molecules is considered, mimicking an ionic liquid environment. We find that molecules adsorption can lead to both n- and p-type conductivity, depending on the charge polarity of the adsorbed species.}

In combination with a continuum elastic model, analytic expressions and the coupling strengths for the deformation potential and piezoelectric interactions are established. We furthermore show that the deformation potential interaction has contributions from both normal and umklapp processes and that the latter contribution is only weakly affected by carrier screening. Consequently, the calculated mobilities show a transition from a high-temperature μ∼T−1 behavior to a stronger μ∼T−4 behavior in the low-temperature Bloch-Grüneisen regime characteristic of unscreened deformation potential scattering. Intrinsic mobilities in excess of 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 are predicted at T<10 K and high carrier densities (n≳1011 cm−2). At 100 K, the mobility does not exceed ∼7×103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Our findings provide new and important understanding of the acoustic el-ph interaction and its screening by free carriers, and is of high relevance for the understanding of acoustic phonon-limited mobilities in general.}

Through characterization by absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of quantum confinement on the material’s electronic structure. With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.}

The films are nearly stoichiometric. The crystallinity enhancement of the films can be attributed to an improvement in the crystallization process related to liquid NiS phases present at the grain boundaries during annealing. Residual phases (NixSy; Ni;…) are distributed at the grain boundaries and do not strongly disturb the properties of the WS2 and MoS2 films.

A low energy edge at 1.2 eV is invariably observed for metal barriers on MoS2.

The miniaturization of electronic circuits is expected to reach fundamental limits in the near future. Two-dimensional materials such as single-layer MoS2 represent the ultimate limit of miniaturization in the vertical dimension, are interesting as building blocks of low-power nanoelectronic devices, and are suitable for integration due to their planar geometry. Because they are less than 1 nm thin, 2D materials in transistors could also lead to reduced short channel effects and result in fabrication of smaller and more power-efficient transistors. Here, we report on the first integrated circuit based on a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2. Our integrated circuits are capable of operating as inverters, converting logical “1” into logical “0”, with room-temperature voltage gain higher than 1, making them suitable for incorporation into digital circuits. We also show that electrical circuits composed of single-layer MoS2 transistors are capable of performing the NOR logic operation, the basis from which all logical operations and full digital functionality can be deduced.}

The semiconducting nature of MoS2 allows it to overcome the shortcomings of zero-bandgap graphene, while still sharing many of graphene’s advantages for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS2 show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS2 to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS2. Both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors were fabricated thanks to the use of gate metals with different work functions.}

Our experiments reveal that the electronic states in all films are localized well up to room temperature over the experimentally accessible range of gate voltage. This manifests in two-dimensional (2D) variable range hopping (VRH) at high temperatures, while below ∼30 K, the conductivity displays oscillatory structures in gate voltage arising from resonant tunneling at the localized sites. From the correlation energy (T0) of VRH and gate voltage dependence of conductivity, we suggest that Coulomb potential from trapped charges in the substrate is the dominant source of disorder in MoS2 field-effect devices, which leads to carrier localization, as well.}

	abstract = {Very thin crystals of molybdenum disulphide, less than 100 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm A}$ thick, have been prepared by cleavage. The optical absorption spectra in the thickness range several micrometres to less than 100 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm A}$ are similar. Absorption coefficients have been measured to values close to 10$^6$ cm$^{-1}$. The absorption bands observed with thin crystals are associated with bulk rather than surface properties. Deviations from an exponential relation between transmission and thickness are observed as the crystal thickness is decreased. The transmission begins to oscillate and thick crystals may transmit more light than thinner ones. Three absorption edges have been observed in the absorption spectrum at about 7000, 5000 and 3000 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm A}$, and structure is observed on the first edge at 4 $^\circ$K. It is suggested that the levels at the top of the valence band are split by spin-orbit interaction. The edges at 5000 and 3000 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm A}$ may be due to transitions at other values of the wave vector or from deeper valence bands. The absorption peaks correspond to exciton lines close to the conduction band. Photoconductivity has been observed at 77 $^\circ$K. A response at both absorption edges is detected, and photoconduction peaks are observed at the wavelengths of the exciton bands. Values for the refractive index have been obtained in the region of the first absorption edge, and out to 2 $\mu$m. Comparison of the optical and low-frequency dielectric constants indicate that the bonding is covalent. The absorption edges and the exciton bands of single crystals and polycrystalline films are compared. The impurity content of the natural crystals has no effect on the properties observed.},

We report the realization of a single-layer graphene p-n junction in which carrier type and density in two adjacent regions are locally controlled by electrostatic gating. Transport measurements in the quantum Hall regime reveal new plateaus of two-terminal conductance across the junction at 1 and  times the quantum of conductance, e2/h, consistent with recent theory. Beyond enabling investigations in condensed-matter physics, the demonstrated local-gating technique sets the foundation for a future graphene-based bipolar technology.},

abstract ={Two-dimensional graphene monolayers and bilayers exhibit fascinating electrical transport behaviors. Using infrared spectroscopy, we find that they also have strong interband transitions and that their optical transitions can be substantially modified through electrical gating, much like electrical transport in field-effect transistors. This gate dependence of interband transitions adds a valuable dimension for optically probing graphene band structure. For a graphene monolayer, it yields directly the linear band dispersion of Dirac fermions, whereas in a bilayer, it reveals a dominating van Hove singularity arising from interlayer coupling. The strong and layer-dependent optical transitions of graphene and the tunability by simple electrical gating hold promise for new applications in infrared optics and optoelectronics.},

  abstract={Approximate analytic expressions are obtained for the scattering rates and momentum-relaxation rates of an electron in a quasi-two-dimensional quantum well interacting with acoustic, optical and intervalley modes via the deformation potential and with longitudinal optical modes via the polar interaction. These analytic expressions are obtained using a momentum-conservation approximation. The threshold for optical phonon emission, unlike the case in the bulk, is abrupt. All scattering rates are energy-independent and are inversely proportional to L, the thickness of the well. The momentum-relaxation rate associated with the absorption of polar optical phonons, on the other hand, proves to be proportional to L. These properties are shown to lead to a negative differential resistance for pure polar mode scattering, and to the existence of a runaway field for deformation-potential scattering. The self-energy associated with the emission of polar optical phonons at absolute zero is shown to be divergent unless the polar interaction is screened, and some consequences of this for laser and other optical processes are pointed out. The description of scattering by perturbation theory breaks down in very narrow wells.}

  abstract={Dichalcogenides with the common formula MX 2 are layered materials with electrical properties that range from semiconducting to superconducting. Here, we describe optimal imaging conditions for the optical detection of ultrathin, two-dimensional dichalcogenide nanocrystals containing single, double and triple layers of MoS 2 , WSe 2 and NbSe 2 . A simple optical model is used to calculate the contrast for nanolayers deposited on wafers with varying thicknesses of SiO 2 . The model is extended for imaging using the green channel of a video camera. Using AFM and optical imaging we confirm that single layers of MoS 2 and WSe 2 can be detected on 90 and 270 nm SiO 2 using optical means. By measuring contrast under broadband green illumination we are also able to distinguish between nanostructures containing single, double and triple layers of MoS 2 and WSe 2. We observe and discuss discrepancies in the case of NbSe 2 .}
